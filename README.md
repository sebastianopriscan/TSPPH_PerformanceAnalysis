# TSPPH\_PerformanceAnalysis

This repository, like its submodule *TSPPartitionHeuristic*, is part of the "*Algorithms and Models for Discrete Optimization*" 2022/2023 course examination. The course is held at University of Rome, Tor Vergata.

Its focus is to test the performance of the *TSP Partition Heuristic* algorithm on various instances taken from TSP libraries found online, in order to check whether the heuristic can give useful solutions or not

# Layout of the repository

The definitive layout of the repository is yet to be defined, so  for the moment only an initial draft will be given:

  - TSPPartitionHeuristic : git submodule containing the heuristic's description and implementation

  - formatted\_instances : directory containing the library-compatible instances eventually converted from the online sources

  - resources : directory containing the instances files taken online

  - results : directory containing the results produced by instance processing

  - adapters : directory containing scripts written in order to transform the instances

  - analyzers : directory containing software for statistical processing of the results
